# piServo
Raspberry Pi Classes for controling Adafruit PWM Boards

This work is based off of and an extention of Adafruit_PWWMServoDriver  
I replaced the Wire library calls with wiringPi calls.  
For this reason wiringPi is required to be installed.

This library will allow you to easily control servor motors
attached to an Adafruit PWM board.
